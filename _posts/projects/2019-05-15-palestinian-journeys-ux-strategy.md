The [Interactive Encyclopedia of the Palestine Question](https://www.palquest.org/){: target="_blank"} (previously titled Palestinian Journeys) is an immersive history-telling platform developed in partnership between [Visualizing Palestine](https://visualizingpalestine.org){: target="_blank"} (a project of [Visualizing Impact](https://visualizingimpact.org){: target="_blank"}), the [Palestinian Museum](https://palmuseum.org){: target="_blank"} and the Institute for Palestine Studies.

I worked with Visualizing Palestine from the initial strategy phase of the project through to concept development and design. Alongside assisting in the development of the initial proposal and budget plan for the project, my primary role was to synthesise the ideas from initial discussions with the partners into a UX strategy for the project.

Our aim throughout the project was to evolve our partners' ideas of a traditional timeline-based platform into an immersive exploration with visual, story-driven content as a primary entry point to engage a wider audience.
