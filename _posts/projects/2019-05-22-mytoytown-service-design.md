[MyToyTown](https://mytoytown.com/){: target="_blank"} is a personalized slot-together wooden play system that I have been developing since early 2017.

Alongside developing the design the design of the toy itself, I also developed a series of service design models and business plans, thinking through the process of growning MyToyTown from a pipeline-based business model into a platform-based model engaging a community of designers and a decentralized network of manufacturers.

The development of MyToyTown was supported by the [SmartESA](http://www.smart-esa.com/){: target="_blank"} accelerator programme and a [Kafalat iSME](http://www.kafalatisme.com.lb/){: target="_blank"} innovation grant.
