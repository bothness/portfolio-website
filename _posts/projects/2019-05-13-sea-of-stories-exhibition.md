*Sea of Stories: Voyages of the Palestinian Archive* is an interactive exhibition charting the stories of three significant archives of the Palestinian revolutionary period &mdash; the Palestinian Cinema Institution, the PLO Research Centre and WAFA News Agency &mdash; as they are displaced and fragmented across the Mediterranean, from Beirut and Amman to Haifa, Cyprus, Gaza, Ramallah, Tunis and the Algerian desert.

The exhibition &mdash; consisting of a series of interactive experiences traversing space and time &mdash; was curated by myself and Hana Sleiman, with animation and interaction design by [The Council](https://thecouncil.com.lb/){: target="_blank"}. I was also responsible for the architectural layout of the exhibition. The work was originally presented at [Dar El-Nimer](https://darelnimer.org){: target="_blank"} in Beirut as part of the 3rd Qalandia International.
