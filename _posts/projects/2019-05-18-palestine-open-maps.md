[Palestine Open Maps](https://palopenmaps.org){: target="_blank"} (POM) is a platform for searching, navigating, downloading and digitizing historical maps of Palestine/Israel.

I initiated the project with [Visualizing Impact](https://visualizingimpact.org){: target="_blank"} on discovering an online collection of hundreds of highly detailed Survey of Palestine map sheets from the British Mandate period. The idea of the project was to "open-source" these raw map sheets by making them navigable and searchable through a slippy map interface akin to Google-maps.
