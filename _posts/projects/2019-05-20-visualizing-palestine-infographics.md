I have worked as a partner with [Visualizing Impact](https://visualizingimpact.org){: target="_blank"} since its founding in 2012. Since the beginning, our flagship project has been [Visualizing Palestine](https://visualizingpalestine.org){: target="_blank"}, through which we aim to harness data-led visual storytelling as a means to empower changemakers to communicate on the complex and politically sensitive rights-based issues.

Over this period, we have developed all manner of visual tools and digital platforms for use online and offline, but our core work has remained in infographics. Our visuals have won international awards, have been featured in numerous printed publications, and have been downloaded and printed by our community for presentations and exhibitions in over 40 countries.
