[MyToyTown](https://mytoytown.com/){: target="_blank"} is a personalized slot-together wooden play system that I have been developing since early 2017.

The idea for the toy originated in a farm construction toy that I designed for my son's third birthday, and inspired by the possibilities offered by laser cutting and uv-printing technologies to develop a high-end toy that could be personalized and manufactured on-demand.

The major features of MyToyTown are its personalization, its simple slot-together design, the possibility to connect playsets to build an entire town, and the fact that it is made entirely from wood.

The development of MyToyTown was supported by the [SmartESA](http://www.smart-esa.com/){: target="_blank"} accelerator programme and a [Kafalat iSME](http://www.kafalatisme.com.lb/){: target="_blank"} innovation grant.
