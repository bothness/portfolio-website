SkyFrame1 is a concept for an adaptable, expandable and duplicable highrise structure for vertical urban development. The structure takes the form of a "mega truss", and is broken down into a series of mixed use vertical neighbourhoods.

This project was developed as my undergraduate architectural design thesis, and was featured in the Architects' Journal student showcase.
