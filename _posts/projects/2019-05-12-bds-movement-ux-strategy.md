[BDS](https://bdsmovement.net){: target="_blank"} (boycott, divestment, sanctions) is a global Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality, with local campaign groups active in at least 40 countries around the world.

The primary aims of this project were to transform the BDS web platform to better serve people new to the movement, and to maximise the opportunities for users to take online actions and join local campaigns.

I worked with [Visualizing Palestine](https://visualizingpalestine.org){: target="_blank"} in developing the overall UX strategy, and took the lead in translating this into a series of UX diagrams, and then into wireframes for each section of the site.
