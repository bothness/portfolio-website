[Palestinian Oral History Map](https://libraries.aub.edu.lb/poha-viewer/map/){: target="_blank"} offers a bilingual (English/Arabic) interface to navigate geographically and chronologically through the Palestinian Oral History Archive (POHA), an archive of over one thousand hours of interviews with Palestinians who lived through the Nakba hosted by the American University of Beirut (AUB). The platform is a single page app built primarily using the Leaflet.js, Typeahead.js and Bootstrap libraries. The back-end makes use of a simple API coded in PHP to pull data from a custom made MySQL database.

I designed and developed the platform through a fellowship with POHA, which built on my earlier work leading the [Palestine Open Maps]({% post_url 2019-05-18-palestine-open-maps %}) project.
