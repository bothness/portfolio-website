This building was the first phase of a two-phase academic building complex for University Campus Suffolk, in Ipswich, UK. It was to be a mixed-use building, to house the School of Nursing and Midwifery, various offices and labs, and a student venue on the ground floor.

Working with RMJM architects, my major role in the project was to guide the environmental design strategies of the building, and in particular developing a methodology to guide the development of the facade layout, to ensure an optimum design strategy for daylight and thermal performance.
