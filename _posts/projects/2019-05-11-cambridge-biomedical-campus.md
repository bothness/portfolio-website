A feasibility study project with NBBJ in London to develop prototype designs for the buildings within the Cambridge Biomedical Campus adjacent to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, UK.

I worked as the main architectural designer on the project, developing the concept designs and presentation visuals guided by two senior architects. Our concept was to create a substantial facade along the main boulevards defined in the masterplan, but to offer the intimacy of smaller scale courtyards within each building.
