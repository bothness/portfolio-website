A National Monument is an art installation and exhibition developed in partnership between [Visualizing Palestine](https://visualizingpalestine.org){: target="_blank"} (a project of [Visualizing Impact](https://visualizingimpact.org){: target="_blank"}) and the artist [Marwan Rechmaoui](https://instagram.com/marwanrechmaoui){: target="_blank"}. The installation consists of 32 wooden topographic reliefs of the major cities and towns of Palestine circa 1947, based on historical maps from the British Mandate and digital topographic data from NASA.

I initiated the collaboration between Rechmaoui and Visualizing Palestine, and worked with the artist over a number of months to develop the concept and topographic reliefs. The final reliefs were CNC cut based on 3D computer models and hand finished by Rechmaoui. I also led the design and curation of the initial exhibition of the work at [Dar El-Nimer](https://darelnimer.org/){: target="_blank"} in Beirut.
