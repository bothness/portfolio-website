A series of data spreads produced for the 2018 publication *Data is Beautiful: Mapping the Arab Documentary Landscape* by [DOX BOX](https://dox-box.org){: target="_blank"}.

I worked from the raw data to develop a series of narrative-based data visualizations to offer insights into the state of Arab documentary filmmaking based on DOX BOX's extensive survey of 200 films and over 100 organizations. The visuals were produced in English, Arabic, German and French, and adapted for both printed spreads and slideshow presentations.
