[Census Map Game](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/playthecensus2021populationmapgame/2022-06-28){: target="_blank"} (AKA Mapbusters) is a game that I led the design and development for at the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The game concept is a mashup of a simple higher-or-lower game and the 1980s TV gameshow "Blockbusters", played on a hex map of local authorities in England and Wales.

The game was released in June 2022 to coincide with the first data release from Census 2021 and reached a wide audience, including being featured on the BBC's [Newscast podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0chpctm#t=26m52s){: target="_blank"} (listen from 26:52).
