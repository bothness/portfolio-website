This project was just a bit of fun. I love maps, but like most people who care about the art of mapmaking, I'm also bored to death of the Mercator projection. Yet, at the same time, the world doesn't fit neatly on a flat page anyway, so I decided to make a wooden world puzzle that doesn't have one neat solution either. It's based on an unfolded icosahedron, and has over 2.6 million possible solutions.

I [shared the idea](https://www.instagram.com/p/BppEdQNjYoA/){: target="_blank"} on Instagram, and was surprised by the response, including being featured on [Met Neds Om Tafel](https://www.metnerdsomtafel.nl/){: target="_blank"} podcast in the Netherlands.
