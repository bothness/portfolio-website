A project to redesign the facade of a 1960s school building during a major refurbishment.

I worked in collaboration with [Atelier Hamra](https://atelierhamra.com/){: target="_blank"} to develop and explore a series of design concepts for the facade. I then analysed each option for its environemntal performance in terms of daylight levels and in order to minimize solar gains and potential risk of overheating.
