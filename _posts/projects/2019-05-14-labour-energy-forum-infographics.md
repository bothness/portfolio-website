An infographic developed with the [Labour Energy Forum](https://labourenergy.org/who-owns-the-wind/){: target="_blank"}, an affiliated policy group within the UK Labour Party.

The aim of the visual, which was printed for use during the 2017 national Labour Party conference, was to show that the vast majority of the economic benefits of the burgeoning UK offshore wind energy sector are being reaped by overseas investors.
