[Executive Magazine](https://www.executive-magazine.com){: target="_blank"} is an independent monthly business publication that covers business, economics and politics in Lebanon.

I have worked regularly with Executive since 2016 to develop charts and infographics to supplement the topics that they cover, from politics and elections to fruit and vegetable exports.
