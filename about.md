The common thread through my work is a desire to build impactful projects that engage with real people and communities. Each project is unique, and I find myself constantly learning by doing, and doing my best to impart this knowledge to others. I have made use of a wide variety of tools and technologies in my work, including web coding languages **(HTML, CSS, Javascript, Svelte, D3, PHP)**, GIS and mapping tools **(QGIS, GDAL, Maplibre)**, data processing **(Python, Excel, SQL)**, graphic design software **(Photoshop, Illustrator)**, CAD/BIM software **(Rhino, Revit, Sketchup, AutoCAD)**, and digital fabrication technologies **(laser cutting, CNC routing, 3D printing)**.
